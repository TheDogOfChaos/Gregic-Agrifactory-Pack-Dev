					- Bushes

			- Planning:
				- Allow the ability to choose if a crop uses the `minecraft:block/crop` model or the `minecraft:block/cross` model
				- Will need a builder class.
				- KubeJS integration for dynamic creation of plants.
				- Forge has native support for recoloring textures. Will prove very useful.
