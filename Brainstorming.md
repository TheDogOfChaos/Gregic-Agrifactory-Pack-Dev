Glossary: 'Remove' = remove all recipes for the thing, and all recipes that it can do.
- ## Mod-specific stuff
	- ### Gregtech
		- MAYBE De-tier GT machines and circuits, to an extent
			- Pyanodons has Mark 1 to 5 for most machines.
		- Have machines locked behind science.
			- Also have machine recipes locked behind science, if possible.
		- Maybe get rid of GT pipes for the most part.
		- Rename GT's research system to something else to avoid confusion
			- Possible names:
				- Analytical System
		- MAYBE massively restructure the whole mod.
		- ULV?
	- ### Mystical Agriculture
		- The only source of ores.
		- Higher-tier seeds must be synthesized or spliced from constituents, after researching them.
			- must think about whether synthetization or splicing would be good - maybe a mix of both?
	- ### Create
		- 'Remove' most functionality and all native sources of RPM/SU
			- definitely keep the logistics side of the mod tho, because I like it, and it fits the Factorio theme.
				- tunnels, funnels & smart chutes are locked behind basic circuits
				- normal chutes are locked behind Automation research
				- mechanical arms are available almost right from the get-go
	- ### Greate (possibly?)
		- Causes a crash when placing belts with Flywheel's **Batching** backend enabled instead of the **Instancing** backend
		- 'Remove' all but the belts, shafts, gearboxes and small gears.
		- Keep the spouting machine? idk
	- ### AE2
		- Gated late into the pack, behind extreme amounts of research and components
		- EXPENSIVE AS FUCK, but still useful.
	- ### Hostile Neural Networks
		- The only source of mob drops (BIG MAYBE)
		- Locked behind advanced bio-engineering research
	- ### Xnet
		- Mid-game item/fluid/energy/logic transportation
	- ### Pipez
		- Early-game energy transportation.
		- Probably will disable all other pipes from the mod.
		- Pipe upgrades will be locked behind research.
	- ### Flux Networks
		- Late-game wireless energy transportation
	- ### Computercraft
		- For the smart people.
	- ### Project Red
		- Also for the smart people.
- ## General
	- ### Heavy focus on being Pyanodons & Krastorio2-like:
		- recursive recipes
		- repurposing byproducts
		- vast processing lines
		- Simple shit like the Create Tunnels are locked behind basic circuits, which in turn are locked behind a slew of other research and processes
	- ### Research
		- Possible styles of the research system: 
			- Factorio style:
				- Research items are produced in assemblers
				- Research items are placed in special researchers that gradually tick up the progress of the selected research quest.
			- Feed the Factory style:
				- Research items are produced in dedicated labs
				- Research items are directly submitted to quests
	- ### Bio-Engineering
		- Mystical Agriculture seeds must be Bio-engineered
	- ### Burner Blocks (BIG BIG BIG MAYBE)
		- Any block that burns fuel items in order to process a recipe will produce ash with every fuel item burnt
